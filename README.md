Click is a project developed and improved during the Software Engineering course at UFC - Quixad√° campus. The system proposes a vote for films to be shown in a school cinema or social project. The purpose of the project is to exercise project development and organization skills.

## Starting

After clonning the repository, run

```
npm i
```
in order to install the right dependencies needed. Then run

```
node server.js
```
to see the server running locally.

This application is under development, so to run the app properly you will need the frontend app running locally as well. In order to get it, see the [FrontEnd repository](https://github.com/oliveiraD4vi/click-project).

It also uses a connection with a Postgres DB, so you will need it. See the .env-example file, and create a .env with those variables. If you want to change the used DB, see [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/getting-started/).
